# MCMC-and-Bayesian-Analysis

This work has been done as second homework for Bayesian Statistics course. 

It's divided in two parts:

## Bayesian analysis of the dugongs age/length

The dataset analyzed regards some observed dugongs (sea cows) captured off the cost of Queensland, in particular we analyze Age and Length of the dugongs.

The covered topics are:
- Data analysis and Visualization
- Full-conditionals
- Markov Chain simulation with Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm
- Posterior Uncertainty
- Estimates

## Markov Chain Analysis

A simple analysis of the behaviour of  a Markov Chain

The covered topics are:
- Empirical Relative Frequency
- Stationary distribution
- Simulations
